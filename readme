This is a app similar to that of paytm or paypl where we can transfer the money. The money will be deducted from the sender user and get credited to the receiver person 
This is just a prototype of how the paytm actually works. 
The project is created using REACT, mongodb, nodejs and express. 
THe restAPI is being used here.
